# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is a top priority for us. If you've identified a security vulnerability in this repository, we kindly request that you follow a responsible disclosure process.

### How to Report

If you discover a security issue, please **do not** create a public GitHub issue. Instead, report the issue directly to:

**Email**: [sushilkumardeveloper@gmail.com](mailto:sushilkumardeveloper@gmail.com)

Please include as much detail as possible to help us assess the issue and resolve it effectively.

### What to Include

In your report, please provide:

- The product version (commit hash from [GitHub](https://github.com/your-repo) or Docker image hash if applicable).
- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- The component or file involved (if known).
- Steps to reproduce the issue.

Once your report is received, a member of the security team will confirm the issue, determine the impact, and work on a fix. The resolution will be pushed to the repository, and a security release will be published if necessary.

We deeply appreciate your help in making this project more secure for everyone.
